                <h1>About Educenter</h1>
                <p>C and C Educenter (the company) was founded in 2011 by Lucia Liu or Teacher Liu. She has been a professional teacher in the Calgary Catholic School Board for 12 years and in China for over fifteen years. Lucia recognized that the systemic differences in the education systems of both countries would create a difficult learning experience for children of immigrants to Canada and students coming to North America to study. C and C Educenter was created to provide consulting and information to parents whose children were coming to North America to study. 
                    The companyâ€™s focus evolved in 2016 after seeing a need for more help for all students studying in Canada. Advanced subject tutoring with certified teachers and subject specialists was added to our services. In 2019, C and C started to offer a STEAM program to help students become better in coding, engineering, and technology.With the Global Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020, the company created online resources and online summer camps for children not used to extended periods at home during the school year. The tutoring and STEAM programs moved online and more online services are added.
